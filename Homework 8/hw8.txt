1.  b)

	To ensure that Pr(D|T) >= 0.3, the constraints given by sensitivity analysis are:

	P(D=Yes) >= 0.008322
	P(T=Positive | D=No) <= 0.002386

	Thus the prior probability of having the disease must be at least 0.008322
	and the probability of a false positive for the test must be at most 0.002386.
	The probability of a false negative for the test does not need to be constrained.

2.  a)

	The most likely instantiation of all variables given that Sambot has 
	sensed the lights to be on, but has sensed no bark is as follows:

	Battery: OK
	DogBarking: No
	DogBowelTrouble: Yes
	DogOutside: Yes
	ExpectingGuests: No
	FamilyHome: No
	LightSensor: On
	LightSensorHealth: OK
	SoundSensor: Off
	SoundSensorHealth: OK

	I obtained this answer by showing the monitor for OutdoorLight and HearableBarking
	and setting OutdoorLight to On and HearableBarking to No and then running MPE computation.
	This gave me the values for each variable and the values P(mpe,e) = 0.153 and P(mpe|e) = 0.370.

	b)

	The most likely instantiation of the sensors given that the family is home 
	and no guests are expected is as follows:

	Battery: OK
	LightSensor: Off
	LightSensorHealth: OK
	SoundSensor: Off
	SoundSensorHealth: OK

	I obtained this answer by showing the monitor for FamilyHome and ExpectingGuests and 
	setting FamilyHome to Yes and ExpectingGuests to No and then running MPE computations. 
	This gave me the values for the sensor variables and the values 
	P(mpe,e) = 0.030 and P(mpe|e) = 0.157.

	c)

	The smallest set of variables Z is Z = {FamilyHome, Battery}. In the network, FamilyHome 
	diverges in a path between SoundSensor and LightSensor. Battery is also directly divergent 
	in the path SoundSensor, Battery, LightSensor. So if Z is given, then the two sensors are 
	d-separated and independent.

	d)

	The network I constructed is a multiply-connected network.
